Example: An analog audio signal from a microphone, temperature varying throughout the day.<br><strong>Discrete-Time Signal:</strong> Defined only at discrete instants of time. It's often obtained by sampling a continuous-time signal. Example: Daily stock market closing values, a digital audio signal."

If input `x1(t)` produces `y1(t)` and `x2(t)` produces `y2(t)`, then `ax1(t) + bx2(t)` must produce `ay1(t) + by2(t)`.<br><strong>Time-Invariance:</strong> A system is time-invariant if a time shift in the input signal causes an identical time shift in the output. If `x(t)` produces `y(t)`, then `x(t-T)` produces `y(t-T)`.<br><strong>LTI Systems Importance:</strong> Crucial because their behavior can be fully characterized by their impulse response. Many complex systems can be approximated as LTI, and powerful mathematical tools are readily applicable."

Transforms a time-domain function to a complex frequency-domain function.<br><strong>ROC:</strong> The set of `s` values for which the integral converges.<br><strong>ROC Significance:</strong> Uniquely defines `f(t)` from `F(s)`, determines causality and stability (ROC includes `jω`-axis for stable systems, right-half plane for causal)."

Transforms a discrete-time sequence to a complex frequency-domain function.<br><strong>Usage:</strong> Converts difference equations into algebraic equations for analyzing discrete-time systems (transfer function, stability).<br><strong>ROC:</strong> The set of `z` values for which the sum converges.

Signal `x(t)` absolutely integrable over one period. 2. Finite number of maxima/minima in one period. 3. Finite number of finite discontinuities in one period."

Solving is algebraic, and inverse transform gives the time response. This is more systematic than solving differential equations directly, especially for complex circuits."

Laplace Transform derivative properties (`L{df/dt} = sF(s) - f(0-)`) directly include these, ensuring the solution reflects the circuit's state at `t=0` and accurately predicts the transient behavior."
